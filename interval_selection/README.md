1. logfile
    - sampling_logs: contains the results of the original hardware counter values obtained by the hardware sampling of 403.gcc
        - The sampling result of 403.gcc is collected in SonicBOOM (Medium) deployed on the Genesys2 board, and contains multiple hardware event information
    - bbvfile: contains the BBV file of 403.gcc generated by gem5
    - bbvdis: contains the BBV distance matrix for each program interval of 403.gcc. (calculated according to the BBV file and the script in cal_bbv_distance)

2. read_sampling_log
    - read the original log file obtained by hardware sampling
    - calculate some new hardware event values, such as MPKI
    - calculate the bottleneck values of the first and second level of TopDown
    - save all hardware event values as a csv file
    - (These scripts are designed based on the current hardware performance counters we collect)

3. mbapis_three_level
    - selection_l1_and_l2: The script of the first two level of MBAPIS, according to the specified sampling result csv file and the concerned hardware events and ratios, select all tailored intervals, and store the positions of these intervals in the file
     - get_selected_bbv: According to the positions of tailored intervals, extract the new bbv file from the original bbv file
     - clustering_l3: Use the new bbv file and cluster analysis to get representative tailored intervals.
     - cal_cluster_error: Use the csv file of sampling results and the interval information obtained by cluster analysis to calculate the estimation error of the intervals selected by clustering analysis

4. cal_bbv_distance
    - From the program's BBV file, calculate the Manhattan distance between each interval and all other intervals, normalize the results, and save to the file

5. drawplot
    - draw_cluster_result.py: Draw the legend of some hardware events of the program, and mark the position information of some selected intervals
    - draw_bbv_dis.py: Draw the BBV distance of the specified program intervals to reflect the similarity between them

6. run_example.py
    - taking the hardware sampling results of 403.gcc as an example, use MBAPIS and Simpoint to select intervals respectively
    - Specific operations include:
        - Use the scripts in read_sampling_log to read the original results of hardware sampling, and calculate some hardware event values and TopDown metric values, and save them as csv files
        - Use the scripts in mbapis_three_level and the sampling result file to complete the selection of MBAPIS and calculate cluster analysis errors
        - Use the script in drawplot to draw a legend of hardware events and mark the positions of intervals selected by MBAPIS
        - Using the script in drawplot, draw the BBV distance of the intervals selected by MBAPIS
